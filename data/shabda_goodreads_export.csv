Brian H. destroys that magic in just one book.<br/><br/>One of the most enjoyable things about Dune is that all factions/entities have shades of grey and plans within their plan. Brian H. books change them to a linear narrative and put entities in a black/white divide. This is infuriating, and entirely at odds with the world Frank H. built.<br/><br/>Eg. In the original books even Tleilaxu are not evil. Loathsome and power hungry, yes. But not evil. They are chaotic-neutral. There are no real antagonists, except humanity's shared past and the uncertain future.<br/>In Herbert/Anderson books they turn into slave traders and organ harvesters. <br/><br/>If you love Dune series for its complexity and heroes of uncertain morality, stay away.","","","","","",0,,,,,

It hooked me to the high fantasy genre.<br/><br/>I read LOTR multiple times. For years I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I started writing fan fiction about it. I read WoT, Mazlan Book, SoT, but they all came short. I was left seeking the first thrill.<br/><br/>And then I found ASOIAF. I threw down the book when Ned dies. I vowed to never come back after the red wedding. I had to take a break when Arya goes blind.<br/><br/>It’s easy to kill off characters.
